Greyscale color observation, 
- use texture rotation
- use texture translation
- not using demos

vel config changes
- use only 128 hidden units
- use 5 num_epoch instead of 3


RESULTS:
- somehow learned to avoid obstacles on level 4, but forget how to approach target in a straight line
- ON SECOND RUN (Record-5-2), it successfully learned obstacle avoidance
- We used the same config for the third run(Record-5-3), with a different curriculum where we never trained with straightline only until stage 4, see ObstacleAvoidanceFirstTrainingScene, result is similar to second run
