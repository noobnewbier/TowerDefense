Greyscale color observation, 
- use texture rotation
- use texture translation
- not using demos

vel config changes
- use only 128 hidden units
- use 5 num_epoch instead of 3


RESULTS:
- somehow learned to avoid obstacles on level 4, but forget how to approach target in a straight line
- ON SECOND RUN (Record-5-2), it successfully learned obstacle avoidance
- We used the same config for the third run(Record-5-3), with a different curriculum where we never trained with straight line only until stage 4, see ObstacleAvoidanceFirstTrainingScene, result is similar to second run
    Performing slightly worse comparing with 5-2, demonstrate a slightly higher tendency on circling obstacle 


IMPORTANT:
---
Curricula used in 5-3:
{
    "measure" : "reward",
    "thresholds" : [7.0, 10.0, 12.0],
    "min_lesson_length": 100,
    "signal_smoothing" : true, 
    "parameters" : 
    {
        "level" : [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    }
}


Decided to compare stability with obstacle first training, run each 5 times, each with 2m episodes. Compare average performance.
