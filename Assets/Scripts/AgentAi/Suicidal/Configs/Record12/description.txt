SUCCESSOR OF 5-3

Greyscale color observation, 
- use texture rotation
- use texture translation
- not using demos
- *use constant learning rate
- use ObstacleAvoidanceFirstTrainingInRectScene, as an attempt to test and see if the circular heat map indicates a problem that hinders training.


RESULTS:
- Learned both Obstacle Avoidance and Target Approaching, however it is not learning "enough". The result overall is not satisfactory.
- see heat map for weird plot.
- Decided to do re-run it, speculating this as the result of randomness.
