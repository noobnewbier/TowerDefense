This is literally record-5-3, we just made a copy of it for better logging.

Essentially this use ObstacleAvoidanceFirstTrainingScene. AND out performing record-5 significantly

IMPORTANT:
---
Curricula used in 5-3:
{
    "measure" : "reward",
    "thresholds" : [7.0, 10.0, 12.0],
    "min_lesson_length": 100,
    "signal_smoothing" : true, 
    "parameters" : 
    {
        "level" : [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    }
}


Decided to compare stability with obstacle first training, run each 5 times, each with 2m episodes. Compare average performance.
