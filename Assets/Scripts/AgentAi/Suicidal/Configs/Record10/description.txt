SUCCESSOR OF RECORD-5-3

Greyscale color observation, 
- use texture rotation
- use texture translation
- use constant learning rate as an attempt to 
    mitigate what's happening towards end of training on 5-3 where rewards become extremely unstable.
- use Obstacle Avoidance First Training Scene
- DOES NOT use navmesh agent
- not using demos


Results:
- Abysmal performance, only demonstrate tendency on approaching target, without regards on obstacle
