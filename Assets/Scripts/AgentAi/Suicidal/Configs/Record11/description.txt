SUCCESSOR OF RECORD-5-3

Aim:
- Analyze why changing target size in curricula helps / not helps training

Greyscale color observation, 
- use texture rotation
- use texture translation
- use constant learning rate as an attempt to 
    mitigate what's happening towards end of training on 5-3 where rewards become extremely unstable.
