SUCCESSOR OF RECORD-5-3

Aim:
- Analyze why changing target size in curricula helps / not helps training

Greyscale color observation, 
- use texture rotation
- use texture translation
- use constant learning rate as an attempt to 
    mitigate what's happening towards end of training on 5-3 where rewards become extremely unstable.


Results:
- "decent" performance, slightly worse comparing to 5-3.
- need to retest with linear learning because you were a moron, it's known as record-11-2

- with linear learning rate it is significantly worst.

Curricula Used:
{
    "measure" : "reward",
    "thresholds" : [7.0],
    "min_lesson_length": 100,
    "signal_smoothing" : true, 
    "parameters" : 
    {
        "level" : [0.0, 1.0]
    }
